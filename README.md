# Learning C Programming (CT401)

This repo is for keeping the records of coding exercises from the first semester  Computer Programming course from BE program (TU, IOE).

## Course Specification

Computer Programming (CT401) is an introductory computer programming course provided by Institute of Engineering (TU) for Bachelor of Engineering (Electronics) program in the first semester. This course covers fundamentals of solution design, followed by programming in C and a little FORTRAN.

### The Units

1. Overview of computer software and programming languages
2. Problem solving using Computers
3. Introduction to C Programming
4. Input and Output
5. Control Statements
6. User-defined Functions
7. Arrays and Strings
8. Structures
9. Pointers
10. Data Files
11. Programming Language: FORTRAN

### Laboratory

About the practical, 

- minimum 6 sets of computer program in C (from Unit 4 to Unit 10) and 2 sets in FORTRAN (from Unit 11) should be done individually.
- student (maximum 4 persons in a group) should submit mini-project at the end of the course

## Project Design

Course specification suggest the programming part starts from Unit 4. In accordance with that here’s our drafter project structure.
